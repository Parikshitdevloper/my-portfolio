        Hi, Iâ€™m Parikshit Chavhan,
        an Android developer passionate about crafting polished,
        user-centric mobile apps. My journey started with Java,
        where I honed my skills in native Android development,
        and evolved into embracing Kotlin and Flutter to build
        modern, efficient, and cross-platform solutions. 
        I specialize in transforming complex ideas into intuitive apps, 
        prioritizing clean architecture, seamless UI/UX with Jetpack Compose, 
        and performance optimization. From migrating legacy codebases to Kotlin 
        and collaborating with designers to bridge Figma prototypes into functional apps, 
        to integrating Firebase for robust backend support, 
        I thrive on solving real-world problems through code.
